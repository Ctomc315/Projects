<p>Introduction The goal of my project was to scrape a popular reddit thread, known as wallstreetbets. This particular thread deals with the stock market, but in its own special way. Many of the individuals are known to take huge, risky bets and post their losses and gains on the site. There is also a lot of satirical content posted along with it which makes it even more entertaining. I wanted to scrape comments and stock tickers, and then perform a sentiment analysis on the comments that I scraped.</p>
<p>Methodology The first thing I did was figure out how to use PRAW, which is a package designed to scrape reddit. I had to go to a site known as “old reddit” in order to get a client id, client secret, and user agent in order to use PRAW. This is because reddit wants to be able to know who is scraping them and what they are doing on their site. From there, I defined the subreddit in particular that I was going to use, which in this case was wallstreetbets. Initially, I did not have my next step in place, but after running my code for the first time, I noticed that it was picking up “tickers” for stocks that weren’t tickers, like WHY or UGH. This prompted me to create a dictionary of valid ticker symbols. I opted for stocks in the S&amp;P500, and added Gamestop in as well due to the notoriety of it in this particular reddit thread. Then, I specified specifically the hot section of the reddit page in order to both not grab the entirety of all comments ever on the particular thread and to capture recently trending things in particular. I then went on to process the comments by stipulating that if the comment has the ticker in the dictionary, to record the time and the comment.</p>
<p>Discussion Overall, the sentiment of the comments associated with a lot of the stock tickers appears to be mostly negative. I think this is really interesting, and maybe speaks to what happens if you bet money on stocks without doing a ton of research. People online also love to hate on things which also probably contributes to overall negative sentiment. To take this project further, I think you could overlay volatility, price movements, and a ton of other metrics along with the comments and sentiment analysis to see if there are any correlations.</p>
<p>I wanted to give another layer to the project, so I decided to make a streamlit app that you could use in conjunction with any stock tickers you find. This streamlit app allows you input any stock tickers of your desire, compare it to the QQQ as a benchmark, and give you a variety of ratios for insights. It also gives you an efficient frontier graph which is a good indicator of your risk versus return ratio! This wasn’t necessarily full a part of the original project, but I thought it was a cool addition and I will add the link to the streamlit app in the comments section of the submission if you want to take a look!</p>

Most of the drop in my port was due to overall conditions, and unrealized. But I also made several bad trades on NVDA, MSTR and XYZ all running and failing in the same week and lost an actual $15k. Definitely learned my lesson (also, moot point bc have no buying power.)

No one is paid, no one buys anything. No revenue, no expenses, money devalues into meaningless as the fallout wars begin, but stocks pump anyway bc the AI CEOs all regurgitate "AI AI AI AI" followed by the complete text of Mein Kampf every earnings call.\n\nTesla cars never achieve full autonomy, but automated locks do prevent anyone from entering (or leaving) the vehicle. People either die of starvation, or are brutally massacred by Palantir-enabled Predator drones mistaking them for ISIS agents. There are no cool wasteland gangs, just Cybertruck technicals berserking around crashing into shit over and over.\n\nEventually everyone is wiped out, rising oceans swallow all continents, and halobacteria once again rule the Earth.

220  NVDA $125 calls and $110 cash secured puts - $25k premium used to purchase 25 80DTE calls *”Margin” means the accounts are margin accounts, it doesn’t mean I’m borrowing money, or I would need to borrow money in case I’m assigned.\n\nClosed my earlier position of -39 50DTE NVDA 120 cash secured puts for a small profit of $2.1k 2 days ago (date of earnings) at open. In hindsight, I should have waited until yesterday at open to close for a bigger profit but I just didn’t feel 100% comfortable with how the market would react to earnings.\n\nYesterday wrote 40 80DTE NVDA 110 cash secured puts for $25k premium. Maximum loss if NVDA goes to 0 is $414.7k \n\nToday used the premiums (and an extra $2k) to buy 25 80DTE 125 calls (should have done this yesterday at close). NVDA has been 120-150 range bound for several months. I believe yesterday’s 8% drop is an overreaction and NVDA will be in the 140 range in March. If im wrong, the calls were 90% paid by the premiums.

NVDA's been range-bound, but you're betting on a bounce with earnings volatility. Remember, even with a 140 target, gamma risk is real. Your calls could evaporate if the stock tanks further. And with the market's reaction to earnings, you might be holding the bag at $11

I think a lot of stocks are undervalued that doesn’t mean I’m willing to dump $400k into them at the current price. Of course if I am 100% sure it’s going up I would have just bought all calls at open today when it was at $117, but I don’t have a 🔮 or my name would be in the news instead of wsb.

Didn’t love NVDA below 120? Don’t worry you’ll love it when it’s 135+ again ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/SargathusWA made a bet that NVDA would go to 140.0 within **1 week** when it was 134.245 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

Their record is now 1 wins and 1 losses

Comment 10:
I’m mad at myself. Most of the drop in my port was due to overall conditions, and unrealized. But I also made several bad trades on NVDA, MSTR and XYZ all running and failing in the same week and lost an actual $15k. Definitely learned my lesson (also, moot point bc have no buying power.)

Who remembers Aaron from NVDAs earnings call? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment 12:
Man, It’s such a relief not holding anything over the weekend. Especially after NVDA completely gaped my ass last week.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment 13:
Burnt by NVDA earnings?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment 14:
Calls on corporations and puts on everything else. No one is paid, no one buys anything. No revenue, no expenses, money devalues into meaningless as the fallout wars begin, but stocks pump anyway bc the AI CEOs all regurgitate "AI AI AI AI" followed by the complete text of Mein Kampf every earnings call.

Tesla cars never achieve full autonomy, but automated locks do prevent anyone from entering (or leaving) the vehicle. People either die of starvation, or are brutally massacred by Palantir-enabled Predator drones mistaking them for ISIS agents. There are no cool wasteland gangs, just Cybertruck technicals berserking around crashing into shit over and over.

Eventually everyone is wiped out, rising oceans swallow all continents, and halobacteria once again rule the Earth. NVDA market cap still reaches $10T, somehow.

Soon the price of a carton of eggs might unironically be worth more than the price of a NVDA share.&nbsp;

Comment 16:
Not overweight AMD yet but down 15% currently and buying more at $95. This is their chance to grab market share from Nvda in gaming with a questionable 50 series launch. AMD can flop if their product pricing continues to be NVDA - $50 ... Radeon needs to go on the offence instead of eating up NVDA's scraps.

Comment 19:
NVDA $125 calls and $110 cash secured puts - $25k premium used to purchase 25 80DTE calls *”Margin” means the accounts are margin accounts, it doesn’t mean I’m borrowing money, or I would need to borrow money in case I’m assigned.

Closed my earlier position of -39 50DTE NVDA 120 cash secured puts for a small profit of $2.1k 2 days ago (date of earnings) at open. In hindsight, I should have waited until yesterday at open to close for a bigger profit but I just didn’t feel 100% comfortable with how the market would react to earnings.

Yesterday wrote 40 80DTE NVDA 110 cash secured puts for $25k premium. Maximum loss if NVDA goes to 0 is $414.7k 

Today used the premiums (and an extra $2k) to buy 25 80DTE 125 calls (should have done this yesterday at close). NVDA has been 120-150 range bound for several months. I believe yesterday’s 8% drop is an overreaction and NVDA will be in the 140 range in March. If im wrong, the calls were 90% paid by the premiums. Worst case scenario, this is basically a limit order for 4,000 shares of NVDA at $110.5 a share, and I’m happy to hold onto NVDA at that price.

Comment 27:
Call it by its name - Risk reversal&nbsp;strategy.  
I too have small NVDA risk reversal positions, 3/14 expiration. I don't like locking up collateral cash for longer than 2 weeks. A lot can happen in 80 days.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment 28:
You're not as clever as you think, poor boy. NVDA's been range-bound, but you're betting on a bounce with earnings volatility. Remember, even with a 140 target, gamma risk is real. Your calls could evaporate if the stock tanks further. And with the market's reaction to earnings, you might be holding the bag at $11
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment 29:
There is no loss between 110-125 (actually a small gain of $1400 per month in interest from money market) whereas buying $417k of NVDA stocks would generate $36k loss if price drops to $110. I think a lot of stocks are undervalued that doesn’t mean I’m willing to dump $400k into them at the current price. Of course if I am 100% sure it’s going up I would have just bought all calls at open today when it was at $117, but I don’t have a 🔮 or my name would be in the news instead of wsb.

Bought SPY 590c at 0.10, sold at 4.05. It actually went up to 4.85 for a moment. Pure gamble from NVDA puts profits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A moment of silence for my fallen brethren that thought NVDA would rocket past $140 on earnings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Was up with NVDA call 30% but held it for Monday to avoid PDT ! Fingers crossed !
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Didn’t love NVDA below 120? Don’t worry you’ll love it when it’s 135+ again ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

NVDA be like:

Great earnings: 🫠

Geopolitical conflict: 🎉

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/SargathusWA made a bet that NVDA would go to 140.0 within **1 week** when it was 134.245 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

Their record is now 1 wins and 1 losses

Today used the premiums (and an extra $2k) to buy 25 80DTE 125 calls (should have done this yesterday at close). NVDA has been 120-150 range bound for several months. I believe yesterday’s 8% drop is an overreaction and NVDA will be in the 140 range in March. If im wrong, the calls were 90% paid by the premiums. Worst case scenario, this is basically a limit order for 4,000 shares of NVDA at $110.5 a share, and I’m happy to hold onto NVDA at that price.

NVDA $125 calls and $110 cash secured puts - $25k premium used to purchase 25 80DTE calls *”Margin” means the accounts are margin accounts, it doesn’t mean I’m borrowing money, or I would need to borrow money in case I’m assigned.

Closed my earlier position of -39 50DTE NVDA 120 cash secured puts for a small profit of $2.1k 2 days ago (date of earnings) at open. In hindsight, I should have waited until yesterday at open to close for a bigger profit but I just didn’t feel 100% comfortable with how the market would react to earnings.

Call it by its name - Risk reversal&nbsp;strategy.  
I too have small NVDA risk reversal positions, 3/14 expiration. I don't like locking up collateral cash for longer than 2 weeks. A lot can happen in 80 days.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You're not as clever as you think, poor boy. NVDA's been range-bound, but you're betting on a bounce with earnings volatility. Remember, even with a 140 target, gamma risk is real. Your calls could evaporate if the stock tanks further. And with the market's reaction to earnings, you might be holding the bag at $11
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no loss between 110-125 (actually a small gain of $1400 per month in interest from money market) whereas buying $417k of NVDA stocks would generate $36k loss if price drops to $110. I think a lot of stocks are undervalued that doesn’t mean I’m willing to dump $400k into them at the current price. Of course if I am 100% sure it’s going up I would have just bought all calls at open today when it was at $117, but I don’t have a 🔮 or my name would be in the news instead of wsb.

Nobody puts NVDA in the same corner as AMD.
